# Binetflow Botnet Detection
---
Using various machine learning techniques to classify bi directional traffic as malicious
botnet traffic. 

### [CTU-13 Dataset](https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/CTU-13-Dataset.tar.bz2)
 
### Run the code yourself.
---
If you want to run the code yourself, you will need to download the dataset from above and extract it into the Dataset folder.
After that you will need to run prune_data.sh. This will remove all the pcap files and keep the binetflow files, as well as
move them up a dir and remove any empty directories. Only do this if you wish use only the binetflows and to save disk space.

## ToDo:
1. Everything...
2. Finish Summary.
3. Begin training models.
4. Continue a lit review and rewrite of paper.
